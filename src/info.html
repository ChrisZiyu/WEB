        <h4>History of the game</h4>
        <article class="info-info">
          <p class="info">
            The game of Sevens is a popular dice game that is believed to have originated in America in the early 1900s. 
            It is also known by several other names, including Liar's Dice, Pirate Dice, and Perudo.

            The objective of the game is to be the last player with dice remaining. Players take turns rolling their dice
             and making bids about the total number of dice of a particular face value that they believe are present among 
            all players. The next player then has the option to either challenge the previous bid or make a higher bid. 
            If challenged, all players reveal their dice and the bid is either accepted or rejected based on the actual num-
            ber of dice of the specified face value. Players who lose dice are eliminated from the game, and play continues 
            until only one player is left.
            Sevens is a game that has been played for generations, with variations and rule changes being made over time. It is popular in many different cultures, with variations of the game being played in countries around the world. The game's simplicity and the fact that it can be played with just a few dice make it a popular choice for social gatherings and parties

            <h3>Introduction of Sevens</h3>
            <article>
                <p class="info">
                    Sevens is a fun little dice game that challenges players to push their luck each round.  During a
                     player’s turn, they will have three chances to score as many points as possible.  Watch out! Any 
                     two dice that add up to 7 are removed.

        <h3>Game Instructions</h3>
            <article>
                <p class="info">
                    Before the game begins, determine how many rounds you are going to play.

                    Each player should roll all six dice.  The player with the highest total gets to go first.
                    On a player’s turn, they get to roll the dice three times in order to get the highest score 
                    possible for the round.  A player begins their turn by rolling all six dice.  After doing so, 
                    they must remove any two dice combinations that equal 7.  Any two dice that add up to seven must 
                    be removed.<br>

                    Once those dice are removed, the player has the choice to either roll the remaining dice, or keep
                     what’s left as their score for the round.  If the player chooses to roll the remaining dice, they 
                     repeat the process of removing any two dice combinations that equal 7.<br> 

                     Finally, if a player chooses, they can roll the remaining dice one more time.  After removing any 
                     two dice combinations that equal 7, that player must keep the remaining dice as their score.
