        <h4>History of the game</h4>
        <article class="info-info">
          <p class="info">
            Sevens is a dice game that has been played for generations and is believed to have originated in America in the early 1900s. 
            It has several other names, including Liar's Dice, Pirate Dice, and Perudo. The objective of the game is to be the last player 
            with dice remaining. Players take turns rolling their dice and making bids about the total number of dice of a particular face 
            value that they believe are present among all players. The next player has the option to either challenge the previous bid or make
             a higher bid. If challenged, all players reveal their dice, and the bid is either accepted or rejected based on the actual number 
             of dice of the specified face value. Players who lose dice are eliminated from the game, and play continues until only one player 
             is left. Variations and rule changes have been made over time, and the game is popular in many different cultures. It can be played 
             with just a few dice, making it a popular choice for social gatherings and parties.

            <h3>Introduction of Sevens</h3>
            <article>
                <p class="info">
                    Sevens is a fun little dice game that challenges players to push their luck each round.  During a
                     playerâ€™s turn, they will have three chances to score as many points as possible.  Watch out! Any 
                     two dice that add up to 7 are removed.

        <h3>Game Instructions</h3>
            <article>
                <p class="info">
                  Before starting the game, decide on the number of rounds to be played. Each player rolls all six dice, 
                  and the player with the highest total score goes first. On a player's turn, they can roll the dice up 
                  to three times to get the highest score possible for the round. At the start of their turn, the player
                  rolls all six dice and removes any two dice combinations that add up to seven. Then, they can choose 
                  to either keep the remaining dice as their score for the round or roll them again and repeat the process
                  of removing any two dice combinations that add up to seven. If they choose to roll the remaining dice for
                  the third time, they must keep the remaining dice as their score after removing any two dice combinations
                  that add up to seven.
