            Hello im Christian Ziyu Ukiike and currently I'm taking the class WEB222. This is the Final Assestment for this semester so I hope I can pass the course!
            I decided to choose <abbr title="Sevens Out">S.O</abbr> since its very easy to understand and play while enjoying a family dinner, being in a bar with the friends since it can bring 
            some joy and good memories.

                On a player’s turn, they get to roll the dice three times in order to get the highest score possible for the round.  A player begins their turn by rolling all six dice.  After doing so, they must remove any two dice combinations that equal 7.  Any two dice that add up to seven must be removed.  Examples include 6-1, 5-2, and 4-3. 

                Once those dice are removed, the player has the choice to either roll the remaining dice, or keep what’s left as their score for the round.  If the player chooses to roll the remaining dice, they repeat the process of removing any two dice combinations that equal 7.

                Most recently, he released his tenth studio album on Ultra Music and was ranked 42nd in the DJ-Mag voting of the Top100 DJs. Boris still plays only his own produced music at his gigs - and the success proves him right. Sold-out halls, screaming fans, TV appearances and weeks of touring - around the globe, he is eagerly awaited at all major festivals.
